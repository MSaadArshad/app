The API code is in server/index.js.\
The Frontend Application code is in client/src/App.js.

To run the API server call `npm start` in the root directory which spins up a local server at port 3001.\
The endpoints can be accessed at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with the correct authentication token.

To run the frontend application code navigate to client directory using `cd client` in a separate terminal window then call `npm start`.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

NOTE: Both client and server code needs to run simultaneously
